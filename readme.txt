1. The code is developed in Python.

2. Libraries Used: pandas,numpy,matplotlib,sklearn

3. Steps to build and compile the code via command line:

Following parameters (train_dataset_filepath, test_dataset_filepath, output_filepath) are passed via command line:

python ml_final_project.py "/Users/punitbhalla/Documents/Course Syllabus/Spring'18/CS-6375-Machine Learning/Homeworks/Project/train.csv" "/Users/punitbhalla/Documents/Course Syllabus/Spring'18/CS-6375-Machine Learning/Homeworks/Project/test.csv" "/Users/punitbhalla/Documents/Course Syllabus/Spring'18/CS-6375-Machine Learning/Homeworks/Project/output.csv"

4. The predicted outputs will be stored in the path specified by output_filepath(output.csv).

NOTE: The command will run only when ml_final_project.py file is present in the current working directory.
